            <h2>Newton's Laws</h2>
            <p>Newton's laws of motion are three fundamental laws of physics that describe the relationship between an object's motion and the forces acting on it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.</li>
                <li>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma).</li>
                <li>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="momentum">
            <h2>Law of Momentum</h2>
            <p>The law of momentum conservation states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, provided no external forces are acting on it.</p>
            <p>In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:</p>
            <p>Î£(mv) = constant</p>
